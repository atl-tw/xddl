Using Glide and PowerGlide to Migrate ElasticSearch Data
========================================================

Moving data from one ElasticSearch mappings structure to another is a common problem. Here we are going to look 
at a way to do this with xDDL, the "migrate" plugin, and PowerGlide.


Before We Start
---------------

We are not going to discuss the details of xDDL specifications here. While we like to think the code should be relatively
self evident, if you would like to know more, please see the [writing a specification](../specification) documentation 
for details.
