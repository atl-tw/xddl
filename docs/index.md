tl;dr: A Swiss Army Knife for Data Specifications
=================================================


xDDL is a format and system for generating artifacts based on a Data Definition Language that is not unlike JSON Schema.
There are a lot of things you can do with it. To get started, pick a case that best fits your need.


 * **I want to [learn more about writing my data definitions](./specification) in xDDL**
 
 * **I want to [migrate ElasticSearch mappings between versions](./elasticsearch) like Flyway does for my SQL databases**
 
 * **I want to [make sure my data models are consistent](./models) between different projects and languages**

We want to make it easy to build something where there are obviously no deficiencies... at least in your data 
definitions.
