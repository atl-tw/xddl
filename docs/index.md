tl;dr: xDDL is a Swiss Army Knife for data specifications
=========================================================


xDDL is a format and system for generating artifacts based on a Data Definition Language that is not unlike JSON Schema.
There are a lot of things you can do with it. To get started, pick a case that best fits your need.


 * **I want to [migrate ElasticSearch mappings between versions](./elasticsearch) like Flyway does for SQL**
 * **I want to [make sure my data models are consistent](./models) between different projects and languages**
 * **I want to [learn more about writing my data definitions](./specification) in xDDL**
